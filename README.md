# Connecting-the-First-Search

_Summer Project'22, Stamatics IIT Kanpur_

## Graph Algorithm

The project has been divided into **4** equally spaced assignments each having a particular topic and related problem statements:

1. Breadth-First-Search **(BFS)**, Depth-First-Search **(DFS)**, Cycles, and Bridges
2. Topological Sorting, Strongly Connected Components **(SCC)**, Directed Acyclic Graph **(DAG)**, and 2SAT
3. Disjoint Set Union **(DSU)**, and Binary Indexed Tree **(BIT)**
4. Shortest Path Algorithms: Djikstra's, Floyd-Warshall, and Bellman-Fords
