# Assignment-4

Following are the tasks for the respective code files in this week's assignment:

1. You can use shortest path algorithms like Floyd-Warshall or Bellman-Fords to check if given graph contains any negative cycle. [Read](https://cp-algorithms.com/graph/finding-negative-cycle-in-graph.html)

2. You have given a weighted directed graph with positive weights. You have to go from vertex 1 to vertex n. Now, modify Djikstra'a Algorithm to find how many shortest length paths are there from 1 to n and what is minumum and maximum number of edges in such path.
