# Assignment-2

Following are the tasks for the respective code files in this week's assignment:

1. Return topologically sorted vector of vertices if possible to get topological ordering otherwise return empty vector. [Link](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1679)

2. You will be given a DAG. You will also be given two vertices u and v. Find out: [Link](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1680)

   1. length of shortest path from u to v
   2. length of longest path from u to v
   3. number of paths from u to v

3. Do SCC decomposition of graph. If there are k SCC in the graph, give each of then unique id from 1,...,k. Return vector which maps each vertex to SCC it belongs to. [Link](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1683)
