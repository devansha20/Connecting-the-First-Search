# Assignment-1

All tasks have been coded in a single file **code.cpp**. Uncomment the required task and run the code.
It includes the following tasks for undirected graphs:

1. DFS which visits all nodes and maintains tin and tout values for each node. Also
   implement a function which when given edge (u, v) classifies it into tree edge or back
   edge.

2. BFS which computes distance from a given vertex s. Return the distance vector.

3. Use DFS/BFS to return connected components of graph. If you have k connected
   components Give each connected component unique id from 1 to k. Return vector
   which maps each vertex to id of connected component it belongs to.

4. Use DFS/BFS to check if graph contains any cycle.

5. Modify bridge finding algorithm to delete all the bridges in graph.
