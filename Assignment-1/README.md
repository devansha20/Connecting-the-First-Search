# Assignment-1

It includes the following tasks for undirected graphs:

## 1. DFS implementation with edge classifier

Classifies (u,v) as either 'Tree edge' or 'Back edge'

## 2. BFS implementation with distance vector

Gives the path from source vertex to required vertex

## 3. Using BFS to classify vertices according to number of connected graphs

## 4. Using DFS to check for any cycles
